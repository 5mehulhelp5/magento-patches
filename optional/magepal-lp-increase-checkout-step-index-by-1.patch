For tracking purposes Lensplaza would like to identify Shipping as Step 2 and Payment as Step 3 during Checkout.
Even though you can add different value in extension's config.xml, logic still pushes step index from Magento's stepNavigator.
Therefore by increasing index by 1, we will have desired result.
